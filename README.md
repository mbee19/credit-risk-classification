Module 20 Challenge for Morgan Bee

This challenge was completed using all class notes and lessons from lecture. I also referred to these articles to better understand and interpret the confusion matrix and classification report: 

- https://builtin.com/data-science/precision-and-recall
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/confusion-matrix-machine-learning/
- https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy-precision-recall 
- https://www.statology.org/sklearn-classification-report/

You can find the final report for this challenge in the file analysis_report_mb.md in the repository.
